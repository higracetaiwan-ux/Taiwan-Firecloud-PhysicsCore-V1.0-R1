# Taiwan Firecloud PhysicsCore V1.0-R5.7.11


R5.7.11 operational focus: Firecloud Shared Geometry Core V1.3. Voxel/layer geometry now separates angle-independent lattice topology from angle-dependent ray materialization, reuses identical topology across solar-angle candidates, and batch-evaluates all target heights at each target distance with a shared ray-height matrix. CASE diagnostics retain target/segment workload counters and add topology cache/materialization timing. Scientific thresholds, optical evidence semantics, Formation/Viewing separation, and six-band RT are unchanged.

R5.7 continues from the verified R5.6.1 baseline. It keeps Formation, Viewing and Photography Decision physically separate while adding forecast-native 3-D hydrometeor optics and an independent Cloud→Observer six-band extinction branch.

## R5.7 additions

- GFS native RWMR / SNMR / GRLE hydrometeor fields are requested and preserved as 3-D forecast evidence. Surface rain rate is never converted to optical depth.
- Sun→CloudBase precipitation optical depth is integrated from native hydrometeor volume with an explicit large-particle visible-band Tier-1 optical model.
- Cloud→Observer precipitation extinction is integrated independently along the viewing ray.
- Viewing geometry uses angular-footprint projected cloud volumes and continuous cloud-fraction interpolation only across vertically continuous adjacent forecast nodes.
- Cloud→Observer six-band gas / aerosol / cloud / precipitation diagnostics are exported separately from Formation RT. No Sun→CloudBase transmission is reused.
- Photography Decision receives Viewing spectral readiness as a diagnostic only; no uncalibrated spectral threshold rewrites Formation or the geometry decision.
- Full Six-Band Formation closure now has a forecast-native precipitation path source when native hydrometeor volume is available. Remaining Missing components stay Missing.

Core invariants remain frozen: Formation != Viewing != Glow; Penumbra Geometry != Spectral RT; Missing != Clear != Zero; Cloud Fraction != COT; Satellite Observation != Forecast Input; Brightness != Redness != Effective Illuminated Area.
